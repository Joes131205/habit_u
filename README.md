# Habit-U

## Description

Habit-U is a web app that leverages AI to create personalized daily plans based on the habits users want to integrate into their routines.

The app utilizes Google Gemini's AI to generate a day plan tailored to the user's submitted habits. This project stems from a fascination with Generative AI and aims to address the common challenge of crafting effective day plans that incorporate positive habits.

## Features

Users must first register using email or Google, or sign in with these credentials. After logging in, they can submit the positive habits they wish to include in their daily routine. The AI then generates a customized plan based on these habits. Users can preview the generated plan and, if satisfied, save it for future reference. Saved plans can be accessed through the Plan Inventory.

Each plan includes a name, a time range for each event, and detailed descriptions. Users can mark events as complete by clicking on them, and completed plans will be indicated as such.
